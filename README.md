This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Starwars search app

The starwars search app is made to be able to search up either starships or vehicles and show the model and their length
using the starwars api. (www.swapi.co)

It is made using redux and react. 

Right now redux is responsible for providing the available search types (starships or vehicles) and manages the api call.

The search is inclusive so if you search for example the letter d, it will search for all names and models that have "d"
included.

Testing is done via Jest using the create-react-app template. I have never worked with JEST so it was fun learning new ways to test.  I used the redux and jest and enzymes articles documentation for testing but was unable to test the components and their interaction with the redux store (for example: If a valid input and select is given it should call on the GET_DATA action).

I also have never worked with redux before so it was definitely also fun learning a new technology.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
